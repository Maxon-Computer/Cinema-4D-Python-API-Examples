"""Demonstrates how to handle colors in scene elements in the context then OpenColorIO (OCIO)
standard.

Since Cinema 4D 2025, OCIO has become the default color management system in Cinema 4D. This code
examples highlights how to write a scene element plugin, an object, deformer, tag, shader, etc.,
that is OCIO aware at the example of an generator object plugin. Highlighted in particular are the
color initlization behavior of NodeData.Init() and the color handling drawing methods such as
ObjectData.Draw().
