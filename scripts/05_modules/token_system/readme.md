# Token System

The token system allows the use of expressions in file names. The API makes it possible to handle these tokens.

It is possible to:

  - Use tokens in file names to customize file locations or file names. For example, they could be based on render settings.
  
  - Add custom tokens to be used everywhere in Cinema 4D.

Classic API:
- **c4d.modules.tokensystem**: *The module which provide static methods to use Cinema 4D's Token System.*
