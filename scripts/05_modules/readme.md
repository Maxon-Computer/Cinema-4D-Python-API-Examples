# Modules

## Introduction

Cinema 4D's functionality is extended with these modules.

## Content

* **assets**: *Provide content as reusable assets served with the Cinema 4D Asset Browser.*

* **batch_render**: *The batch renderer allows to organize multiple rendering jobs in a render queue.*

* **bodypaint**: *BodyPaint is a module that allows drawing bitmap textures on polygon objects. The BodyPaint API allows to access the edited textures.*

<!---  * **character_animation**: *The character animation module provides advanced tools for creating and animating character rigs.* -->

* **colorchooser**: *Color swatches are a system to handle colors or color groups. These color groups can be stored with Cinema 4D itself, a BaseDocument or a preset.*

<!---  * **dynamics**: *The Dynamics module provides tools for soft and rigid body simulations.* -->

<!---  * **hair**: *The Hair module allows the creation of hair objects.* -->

* **lod_object**: *The LodObject represents a LOD (level of detail) object generator. This generator creates geometry based on various parameters e.g. camera distance.*

* **mograph**: *The MoGraph module allows the creation of dynamic animations. It is based on cloners, effectors and fields.*

* **motion_tracker**: *The Motion Tracker API provides read-only access to properties of the Motion Tracker object. It is possible to access information on the loaded footage and on the created 2D tracks.*

<!---  * **particles**: *The basic particle system provides a simple particle generator and basic effectors.* -->

* **node**: *The node API allow you to manipulate nodes in both the materials and scene.*

* **snap**: *The snap module lets you access to the snap settings, quantifying options, workplane etc.*

<!---  * **sculpting**: *The Sculpting module allows to edit high-poly meshes using special sculpting tools.* -->

* **substance**: *Allegorithmic Substance is a procedural texturing system. Substance assets can be created with Substance Designer from Allegorithmic and imported by Cinema 4D using the described API.*

<!---  * **team_render**: *Team Render allows to render a scene on multiple machines in the network.* -->

* **thinking_particles**: *Thinking Particles (TP) is an advanced particle system.*

* **token_system**: *The token system allows the use of expressions in file names. The API makes it is possible to handle these tokens.*

* **volume**: *The Volume module allows to import and edit OpenVDB data.*

* **xpresso**: *XPRESSO is a node-based system to create custom expressions.*
