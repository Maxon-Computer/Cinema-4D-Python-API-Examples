# Files Medias

The classic API and MAXON API provide tools and classes to handle file and media data. If possible, the classes of the MAXON API should be preferred.

Classic API:
- **c4d.bitmaps.BaseBitmap**: *The bitmap class can be used to load, read, draw and save bitmap pictures of various formats.*
- **c4d.storage.MultipassBitmap**: *An extension of the BaseBitmap class that supports higher bit depths, floating point images and multiple layers.*
- **c4d.storage.HyperFile**: *Hyper files are used to store data in a file. The HyperFile works with the `FIFO` concept. The values will be written and read in the same order.*
- **c4d.storage.MemoryFileStruct**: *Used to write to memory instead of to a file.*

Maxon API:
- **maxon.Url**: *Defines the location of a file or a similar resource*.
- **maxon.InputStream**: *An input stream is used to read data from a resource defined with a maxon::Url.*
- **maxon.OutputStream**: *An output stream is used to write data to a resource defined with a maxon::Url.*
