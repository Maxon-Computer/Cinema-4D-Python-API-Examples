# 3D Concept

## Introduction

The Cinema 4D API provides classes to describe complex 3D scenes and tools to edit polygon meshes.

## Content

* **modeling**: *The Cinema API provides the base classes for modeling in Cinema 4D. The MAXON API provides further, advanced modeling tools.*

* **rendering**: *The Cinema API provides tools to render a given BaseDocument*

* **scene_elements**: *Information about scene settings, take system, objects, tags, materials, shaders and animation.*

  * **animation**: *Keyframe animation of parameters is organized in tracks, curves and keys.*

  * **materials_shading**: *Handling materials, shaders, and texture paths.*

  * **scene_elements**: *Handling objects (Camera Object, Instance Object, etc...) and tags.*
  
  * **scene_management**: *Scene management such as layers, markers, undo, etc...*
  
  * **take_system**: *The Take System makes it possible to handle variations of a scene in one BaseDocument.*

* **simulation**: *Contains code examples for the simulation tools of Cinema 4D, such as its particle system.*
