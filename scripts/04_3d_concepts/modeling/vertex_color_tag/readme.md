# Vertex Color Tag

Color attributes can be assigned to vertex through a Vertex Color Tag that stores RGBA colors for the polygons of the host polygon object
The tag can be either in point mode or polygon mode. In point mode it will store color information for each vertex of the object.
In polygon mode it will store color information for each vertex of each polygon of the object.

Classic API:
- **c4d.VertexColorTag**: *A c4d.VariableTag that stores RGBA colors for the polygons of the host polygon object*
